FaceDetectionCrop
==========
This is a python script to crop images based facial recognition. It has two options, create from a web cam or from a saved image (jpg or png). OpenCV is being used to detect the facial region and PIL to do the cropping.

Pyinstaller is being used to compile the script into a runnable EXE. Currently you must have the HaarCascade in the same directory for the script to run. A runnable EXE can be found the release section of this project.

Please submit all bugs, feature requests and questions under the Report Issue section of this project. You can find a running change log listed below.
